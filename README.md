# Keyboard "Manager" for iOS
Have you ever been frustated when it comes to manage the keyboard in your iOS app?

Well, the "Keyboard" class is made for you.

---
######Keyboard provides some useful infos :
	
	var visible: Bool (readonly)
    var window: UIWindow? (readonly)
    
    var startFrame: CGRect? (readonly)
    func startFrame(inViewController vc: UIViewController) -> CGRect?
    func startFrame(inView view: UIView?) -> CGRect?
    
    var endFrame: CGRect? (readonly)
    func endFrame(inViewController vc: UIViewController) -> CGRect?
	func endFrame(inView view: UIView?) -> CGRect?
    
    var animationDuration: Double? (readonly)
    var animationCurve: UIViewAnimationCurve? (readonly)
    var animationOptions: UIViewAnimationOptions? (readonly)
    
######`UIViewController` & `UIPresentationController` are extended to implement these methods :
	
	func keyboardWillAppear(animated: Bool)
	func keyboardDidAppear(animated: Bool)
	func keyboardWillDisappear(animated: Bool)
	func keyboardDidDisappear(animated: Bool)
	

######And forget about initiating animations, just use `animateAlongsideWithKeyboard()` like this :
	override func keyboardWillAppear(animated: Bool) {
        	super.keyboardWillAppear(animated)
    
        	self.animateAlongsideWithKeyboard({ keyboard in
            	// execute your animations here and use the keyboard to get the info you need to update your layout
        	})
    	}


##SDK & Language

iOS 8.0 / Swift 1.2


##Usage
First of all, you must enable the module. We extended `UIApplication` so you'll just have to do this in your `AppDelegate` :
	
	func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
	        UIApplication.KeyboardManager.enabled = true
	        return true
	    }

Now, let's imagine a common usage of the keyboard : UIViewController with UITextField(s).

	class MyViewController: UIViewController {	
	    
	    â€¦
	    
	    //MARK: Keyboard Management
	    
	    override func keyboardWillAppear(animated: Bool) {
        	super.keyboardWillAppear(animated)
    
        	self.animateAlongsideWithKeyboard({ keyboard in
            	if let keyboardEndFrame = keyboard.endFrame(inViewController: self) {
                	self.textFieldsViewBottomConstraint.constant = max(0, self.view.frame.height - keyboardEndFrame.minY)
                	self.view.layoutIfNeeded()
            	}
        	})
    	}
    
    	override func keyboardWillDisappear(animated: Bool) {
        	super.keyboardWillDisappear(animated)
        
        	self.animateAlongsideWithKeyboard({ _ in
            	self.textFieldsViewBottomConstraint.constant = 0
            	self.view.layoutIfNeeded()
        	})
    	}

	}


As you can see, the simplicity comes by the `keyboardWill(Dis)Appear` & `keyboardDid(Dis)Appear` functions, plus the ability to unify your animations using the `animateAlongsideWithKeyboard()` function.
